# Musily

Musily is an application designed for musicians and audio enthusiasts to visualize sound in real-time. It provides detailed insights into sound waves, including bass levels, pitch, and waveform representation. This tool helps musicians analyze their music, fine-tune their compositions, and better understand sound dynamics.

## Features

- **Real-time Sound Visualization**: Displays waveforms dynamically as audio is played.
- **Bass Detection**: Identifies and highlights low-frequency components.
- **Pitch Analysis**: Detects pitch variations in real-time.
- **Frequency Spectrum**: Provides a visual breakdown of audio frequencies.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI for musicians to quickly analyze sound without technical complexity.

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Play an audio file or use the microphone to capture live sound.
3. View real-time waveform analysis, bass levels, and pitch detection.
4. Adjust settings for customized sound analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for backend processing
- **PyAudio** for real-time audio capture
- **Librosa** for pitch and frequency analysis
- **Matplotlib** for waveform visualization

## Future Enhancements
- Support for different file formats
- Advanced equalizer and filtering tools
- Integration with MIDI for better musical analysis
